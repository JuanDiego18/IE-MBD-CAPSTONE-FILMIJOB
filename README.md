In the current  fast-paced and globalized world, it is vital that each company chooses the right hiring process and ensures that it follows it in an efficient manner. On average, the hiring activity lasts around 43 days from the first step to the last (McConnell, 2022). The recruitment process  consists of the following six phases: 

 1. Identifying the need for a new employee.
 2. Publishing the job description. 
 3. Receiving applicantsâ€™ resumes.
 4. Evaluating all the received resumes.
 5. Conducting interviews with appropriate candidates.
 6. Hiring the candidate which fits best for the position. 

Creating an effective recruitment environment can help companies save costs and choose the right talent for each job position. According to GMP Recruitment, almost 74% of employers admit to hiring the wrong person for a position. The statistics show how it is becoming a collective issue, which the majority of employers experience and as a consequence suffer a financial loss. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the inefficiencies and find the right solution.  Some of the most common inefficiencies within the hiring process include: poor planning, communication and clarity, delays, and utilization of incorrect technology. The last factor, similarly as the other inefficiencies, can have heavy negative consequences and impact the recruitment (McConnell, 2022). Therefore, it is vital that each software interviewing method type helps the process  to increase the efficiency and ultimately its accuracy.
